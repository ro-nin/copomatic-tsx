"Do you consider yourself a HIGH CONCEPT individual? If the answer to this extremely dense question is YES, oh well you just found the HIGH CONCEPT toolkit for your everyday HIGH CONCEPT necessities. Whether you are listing your own soft, medium, hard, or VERY HARD skills in your resume for that fancy big-cash corporate job you’re aiming for, or just trying to forge a new identity after a dissociative alcohol-induced manic episode, COP-O-MATIC is that HIGH CONCEPT instrument that will serve your very special needs:
Among the endless possibilities and philosophical implication bundling with COP-O-MATIC, you’ll be able to:
•   Choose your own NAME? NAME... what a concept.
•	Choose your Attributes and Skills, style and even the size of your SOUL, if you have one of course.
•	Express yourself with a range of fashionable clothes and see how does that affect your identity.
•	Save your new self as a digital image for everyone to see.
Mobile responsive design you ask? What kind of LOW CONCEPT request is that?"

"The code is an half mess because 1. so are we, 2. the whole thing started as an improv thing and I didn't plan to make it public, but maybe someone out there could still find some of it useful for future projects. Design is not responsive, sorry (Sorry Cop +1). Update/bug-fixes may come but probably not since who cares (Apocalypse cop +1)."
